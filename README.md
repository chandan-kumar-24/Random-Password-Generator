# Random-Password-Generator

<ul><p>Ever thought about creating a password generator? Well, you're in luck!</p>
<p>This is an open source project that allows users to generate strong passwords.</p>
<p>The code generates a random password of length 10 with the following rules:</p>

<li><p>The password will contain at least one uppercase letter (A-Z)</p></li>
<li><p>The password will contain at least one lowercase letter (a-z)</p></li>
<li><p>The password will contain at least one number</p></li>
<li><p>The password will contains not only characters from the English alphabet and numbers, but punctuation symbols also which makes it even more harder to crack.</p></li></ul>
